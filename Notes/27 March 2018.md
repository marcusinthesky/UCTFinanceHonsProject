 # Literature Review
 The Literature Review must not be more than 5 pages.  It must include the real core.  Main themes that have developed since then.  Key themes since then.   Don't just give a template for each paper, this 1. 2. 3. 4., done, next.   
   
Can be by Theme or Chronology.  Must flow.  Don't worry to much about the original methodologies.  Focus on application.  

Might have stuff after literature review, called technical overview in which we go over that content.  
     
Best mark, was for a 17 page thesis.  
  
Note that the second, external marker, may not be that technical and so you will need ensure effective language.  This paper far more resembles the journal than a thesis.  

Must be ready to copy and paste.
