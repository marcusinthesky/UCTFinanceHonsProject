# Introduction
According to the Efficiency Market Hypothesis, [@Fama1972]

Random Walk Theory [@Magdon-Ismail1998]



# Brief Literature Review
_Not just a summmary, criticize and look for questions this research raises_

[@Gidofalvi2001b]

# Problem statement and analysis

## Key Research Questions
Using the state-of-the-art techniques in Natural Language Processing, this paper aims to investigate the use of popular news sources in share price prediction on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.  

Using state-of-the-art techniques in Natural Language Processing, do publically availible news articles serve as price signals on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange?

## Importance of Research
_Use this chapter to present a clear outline of the problem or issue that you will address, including:_  
_-Who has responsibility for the problem?_  
_-What has already been done to try to solve it?_  
_-What will happen if the problem is not solved?_  
To-date, little research has been used conducted on JSE
We aim to extedn the literature int eh use of newly developed continous word vector repsentations ot analyze market sentiment

# Objective and final outcomes
This research aims to estimate a predictive models that can be used in the real-world to achieve above average market returns.  

# Approach

## Datasources
Data for this project will comprise of articles scraped from popular news services.  This data is publically availible and contains information on the source, time of publishing, a title and the article itself.  

## Methodology
The projects aims to compare the use of various vector representations and embeddings for Natural Langauge Processing, these include the use of Bag-of-Words, N-gram and continuous vector representations [@Mikolov2013].  This research will take an event-based approach and compare the use of Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Kernel Support Machine Models.  

# Conditions and risk analysis

## Resource Requirements
This project will require access to the University of Cape Town's High Performance Computing Fascilities, this is required due to the size and complexity of the models estimated.  

## Research Planning
